# Cline rules

## Rules of Engagement

* When you are caught in a loop, suspend the on-going task and raise
  your hand early, so that I can break the complex task down into steps
  before spending tokens.
* Consider splitting source files when a production source file reaches
  980 lines or when a test source file reaches 480 lines.  Avoid each
  reaches 1000 lines and 500 lines respectively.

## Execution environment

On Windows, use Git Bash or MSYS64 instead of PowerShell to ensure
UNIX-style commands can be executed.

## Test

When modifying any implementation, update the corresponding integration
tests to ensure they cover the changes made.

## Documentation

When modifying any implementation, update the `README.md` document,
manual pages, and `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the changes.

## Text file standards

* Use "Typewriter spacing" style (two spaces after full stop) except
  for manual pages.
* Prefer British spelling over American spelling except for proper
  nouns.
* Lines should be wrapped at 72 characters (never exceed 72 characters
  unless the line is preformatted).  Trailing punctuation may appear
  after the 72-character limit if necessary.
